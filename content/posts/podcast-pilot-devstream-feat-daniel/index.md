## Why "Fireside Chat"

### TL;DR

The podcast show's name "DevOps Fireside Chat" is inspired by [the "Fireside Chats" series by KI labs GmbH](https://medium.com/ki-labs-engineering/tagged/diversity), authored by friend/former colleague [Wyatt Carr](https://medium.com/@carrjwyatt).

### The Story that Inspired the Name "Fireside Chat"

I know. Many talk shows and podcasts name themselves "fireside chat." But this isn't a story of "how we can't think of a better name, so we unimaginatively named it fireside chat;" this is a story on a much more personal level:

I joined this tiny start-up named KI labs in its early stage. It was April 2018, and KI was my first home after I arrived in Munich, Germany. We had a small and agile team, twenty-ish people squeezed in a historical building (easily over 100 years) near [Marienplatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marienplatz).

I was hitting the ground running from day 1, delivering on a personal-best level of efficiency. I had to, because we were working on multiple projects simultaneously. Back then, I was [architecting and building cool stuff for fortune 500 companies](https://www.guotiexin.com/portfolio,/) from the ground up.

As we grew, we moved offices twice, from 20-ish to 80-ish people. During the process, I was appointed the head of the engineering committee, acting as CTO. Later, my personal interest and the need of the company bifurcated; I hired another CTO to replace me to focus more on the cloud infrastructure architect side.

Then there was a beautiful day in the spring of 2019 when we were at [No.44 of Oberanger street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Oberanger+44,+80331+M%C3%BCnchen,+Germany), close to the city center. To this day, I still remember that bright day vividly: I was sitting in a huge meeting room with Wyatt, where we had a delightful conversation, which formed the 10th episode of KI labs' Fireside Chats.

Since then, I have always remembered a fireside chat's warmth and magical feeling. Of course, no actual fireside was involved, although it could be possible, considering it was in Germany.

## Pilot

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_pilot):

> A television pilot (also known as a pilot or a pilot episode and sometimes marketed as a tele-movie) is a standalone episode of a television series that is used to sell a show to a television network or other distributor. A pilot is created to be a testing ground to gauge whether a series will be successful. It is, therefore, a test episode for the intended television series, an early step in the series development, much like pilot studies serve as precursors to the start of larger activity.
> 
> A successful pilot may be used as the series premiere, the first aired episode of a new show, but sometimes a series' pilot may be aired as a later episode or never aired at all. Some series are commissioned straight-to-series without a pilot. On some occasions, pilots that were not ordered to series may also be broadcast as a standalone television film or special.

## DevStream feat. Daniel Hu

Finally, welcome to the pilot (very first) episode of the DevOps Fireside Chat podcast!

This episode is in Mandarin. Sorry for English-speaking readers and listeners; we will surely host chats in English.

In today's episode, we invited Daniel Hu, the PMC member of DevStream, a CNCF open-source project. We discussed DevStream, DevOps, work-life balance, and more. Stay tuned!
